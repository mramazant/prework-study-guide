# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- A prework-study course, which is fun for me, motivates me to start the BOOT-CAMP course.
- I made this project in order to learn what HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript do in a web page and to apply it in real life.
- It is a project that allows people who do not have much idea about programming and webpage to gain a preliminary knowledge by entering the subject. It solves the problem of people who are afraid about it.
- By entering the developer world, I learned what kind of business environment there is here. Apart from that, I learned more about Git and GitHub. As an engineer, I learned about computational thinking as well as solution-oriented thinking. I found the opportunity to improve myself more in coding. I learned what the terms HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mean. At the end of this prework study, I felt more knowledgeable and gained self-confidence before the course.
